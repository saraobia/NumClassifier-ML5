# NumClassifier-ML5
This is an M.L. algorithm that identifies numbers between 1 and 9.

# # Info
The model was pre-trained by me using 90 images of numbers with a range of 1-9 beforehand and then the weights were saved in the /model folder.
To improve the model's confidence my advice is to increase the number of images in the training step.
